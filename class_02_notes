Serperation of concerns is the golden rule:

- HTML = Content/Structure
- CSS = Style
- JS = Behaviour/Interaction


We must use the correct tags on our web pages for several reasons:

- To allow people who use screen readers to view our Content
- To allow Google to rank our webpage


Heading elements (tags)

<h1> MOST IMPORTANT </h1>
...
<h6> LEAST IMPORTANT </h6>


Other Text elements

<p> Paragraph </p>
<span> Short text </span>


Assisted Device elements

<em> Stress Emphasis </em>
<strong> Strong Importance </strong>
- We must use these for ASSISTED reasons, not for visual reasons


Ordered and Unordered list

- <ol> and <ul> with <li> tags around the list items


Containing elements

- <div>, older tag that usually has a much more appropiate tag to use 
- <section>, partition seperate relating parts of the website
- <article>, what can we section together that makes sense on its own
- <aside>, think for things like adverts 
- <header>, for content at the beginning of the document
- <footer> "" end ""
